    'We tried to adhere to the Scrum methodology when working on the project. We chose Jira as the tool for task management.\nEach sprint began with sprint planning, where we clarified the criteria, discussed tasks and divided them into smaller ones. During the sprint, we met for dailies, where each team member shared the status of their tasks. The sprint ended with a retro meeting, where we discussed the results of the sprint and worked on a retro board, where the advantages and disadvantages of the teamâ€™s work methodology were listed, as well as solutions to improve it. We used Planning poker to evaluate tasks during the grooming backlog.\nWe also tried to minimize repetitive and routine tasks by setting up automation for Jira, automatic deployment and pre-deployment for each pull request.',
